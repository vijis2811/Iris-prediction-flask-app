Iris Flower Prediction Web App (Flask + Machine Learning)

This repository contains a simple Flask web application that uses a Logistic Regression model trained on the Iris dataset to predict the species of an iris flower based on user-entered measurements.

The project demonstrates:

How to train a Machine Learning model

How to scale features using StandardScaler

How to save the model and scaler using Joblib

How to build a Flask web app to collect user input

How to make predictions and display results on a web page

It is an excellent beginner-friendly ML + Flask project.
